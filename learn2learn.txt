1-1 [Diffuse/focused modes]
What do you do when you can't figure something out?
> Learn more easily and be less frustrated
(figuring something != learning)
What if you need new ideas and approaches?
Your "focused mode" thought blocks this flow!
Similar to changing step size during gradient descent
---
1-2 [Course structure]
Skills vs techniques for learning
You can fool yourself about whether you know the material
Better focus
Learn more efficiently
Avoid procrastination
---
1-3 [Using diffuse/focused]
You need to do a little work every day - "neural scaffold"
Metaphors are a powerful technique for learning
Learning takes TIME!
(maybe that's why the bus work so well?)
---
1-4 [What is learning?]
Boils down to synapses forming between neurons
Default mode network: scientific evidence for the "diffuse mode"
Unconscious thinking and sleep
---
1-5 [Procrastination]
Not wanting to do something = pain, discomfort
Focus 25 minutes - then relax
---
1-6 [Practice makes permanent]
You must practice to solidify thought patterns
Very important for abstract ideas!
Focus intently - then relax
---
1-7 [Introduction to memory]
Working memory vs long term memory
Spaced repetition works better than cramming
---
1-8 [The importance of sleep]
Go over what you're learning before a nap or sleeping
It helps to consolidate learning (and is healthy anyway!)
---
1-9 [Interview with Dr. Sejnowski]
Learn by doing, "osmosis"
Active engagement is better than passive listening
Jogging helps to engage diffuse mode
Context switching needs practice and is important
^ How To Get Things Done
An enriched environment strengthens learning
DONT BE A MONK IN A ROOM :X (exercise also helps)
Creativity feeds off creative environments
Don't get hung up on a question
Passion and persistence trumps intellect - don't give up m8!
"Different set of eyes"

Optional 1: Benny the Irish Polyglot
Make sure you have a good motivation
Don't be afraid of making mistakes
Everyone has challenges, don't look for excuses

---
2-1 [Intro to Chunking]
How to form adequately sized packages of information
Effective study methods
Illusion of competence and overlearning
---
2-2 [What is a chunk?]
Facts are better learned by introducing larger context
Chunks can become larger through practice and association
"Like getting dressed in the morning"
---
2-3 [How to form a chunk pt1]
Kind of learning a song: practice short passages and then put together
Or dance... or sport... so maybe that's why those feel easier!
This is why worked examples are given in math & science
^ think about why each step was taken and the order in which they happened
---
2-4 [How to form a chunk pt2]
First step: FOCUS! Remove ALL distractions
Context to idenify when to and NOT to use a chunk
Big picture: take a glance at chapter headings/lecture
---
2-5 [Illusions of competence]
Re-reading < much worse < Recalling after reading
(better than drawing concepts maps even!)
Re-reading only effective if spaced
Illusion of competence: test yourself to avoid thinking you know sth you don't
Recall outside of your study context
---
2-6 [What motivates you?]
It's easy to learn if you have the right attitude!
(but I don't think knowing the exact chemistry helps you directly...)
Promising yourself a post-study reward might be helpful though
---
2-7 [The value of a library of chunks]
Learn different patterns that will enrich your toolset
It gets easier the more solid the base -> rich get richer
---
2-8 [Overlearning, choking, einstellung, interleaving]
Continued practice after mastering can lead to overlearning
Repetitive learning during single long sessions is inefficient
Deliberately focus on what you find more difficult!
Einstellung: an initial thought can prevent a better solution
^ local optima
Be ready to UNLEARN!
Don't jump into the pool before learning how to swim.
---
2-9 [Summary]
Chunk: pieces of information bound through use and meaning
^ easy to access
Simple recall best way to develop them
Recall in different contexts
Interleaving to enrich learning in a single session
Deliberate practice to avoid easy stuff
---
2-10 [Interview with Dr Norman]
Works as a group, explain to others
Seek different ways of sensory input
---
3-1 [Intro]
Procrastination and Memory

3-2 [Tackling Procrastination]
Habits
---
3-3 [Zombies everywhere]
Habits can save energy
> Cue     - triggers a habit
> Routine - the act
> Reward  - what feelz good
> Belief  - reinforces the habit as part of you
---
3-4 [Surf's Up]
Mental tools to inspire and motivate yourself

Commit to routine and task
Savor happiness and triumph between tasks
Delay reward until you've finished
